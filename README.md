## Unit names

+ Worker/Farmer

## Ideas

+ [ ] Create funny ideas that people will have trouble throwing away.
+ [ ] To make new units the other units have to have sex...which MEANS they are not working.
+ [ ] Everytime a base (worker) is clicked 5 times a random phrase is utttered.

### Random Phrases

+ Clicking Clicking clikcing....CHOOSE an action really.
